README

You can either run this file from the command prompt using the location of the command file as an argument OR
you can enter the translator.java class and edit the 18th and 19th lines of code by:
	- uncomment line 18 and replace with the location of the command file
	- comment line 19

Also you will need to specify the address of your output txt file. To do this, you will need the address of the text file
paste it in line 39 with double \ so the filewriter can use or create a text file at that directory

Also, some of the write up was done before I sorta cleaned this project of unecessary classes and comments (mainly
System.out.println calls i used to debug). The project still works and will run.

To change the seed of the randomize, Puzzle.java has the seed as a class under the field seed.

Enjoy :)
